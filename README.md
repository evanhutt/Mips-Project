1.The problem
At times radiation from outside the world or "cosmic raidation" can flip bits in a computer or electronic machine. 

2. Causes
The Cause of the issue is a particle of raidation hitting the device and changing a bit. 

3. Effects
The largest Effect of this can be given in a voting example that took place in belgium. What happened was a bit was flipped in the electronic voting system. This gave one of the runners a very large lead in the race. So much so that she had more votes than people that lived in that region. 

5. People impacted if left unsolved
In reality everyone could be effected by this. If given the right circumstances it is possible that a salary could be changed in a computer system. This could effect how much a person would make from their job. This can also effect scientific results that would be hard to reproduce. It would give us back data that was not correct and could change how a launch angle is calculated on a rocket for example.

6. Brief description of how this project addresses that need
This addresses the need for redundancy in a system. This makes it so two values must be magically flipped for a value to be incorrect. This would be perfect for critical systems for voting and scientific findings.
